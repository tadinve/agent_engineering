# Class 02 Grading Criteria

Used with `../../GRADING-RUBRIC-TEMPLATE.md`. These are the criteria specific
to this class — the things `pytest tests/ch02` cannot check.

1. **Directory structure reflects understanding, not memorization.** Each
   directory's purpose should be traceable to a reason (config for business
   context, outputs for gitignored generated artifacts, etc.), not just
   present because the reference has it. Ask the submitter — or infer from
   any comments/README — whether they could explain *why* `outputs/` is
   gitignored and `config/` isn't.

2. **`.claude/settings.json` is minimal, not pre-loaded.** Chapter 2 is
   workspace setup only — no hooks, no elaborate permission rules. A
   submission that's already added permissions or hooks configuration is
   working ahead of the material (Chapter 25, Book 3) without the context
   for why those choices are being made. Flag it as premature, not wrong.

3. **`CLAUDE.md` is still a placeholder, and says why.** Chapter 3 is where
   this file gets written for real. A submission that's already filled in
   real operating rules has skipped ahead; a submission with a bare empty
   file hasn't engaged with *why* it's deliberately empty yet. The gold
   reference's placeholder explains the reasoning in a few lines — look for
   that same reasoning, not necessarily the same wording.

4. **The test suite verifies meaningful things, not just existence.** A
   submission that only checks "does this directory exist" without also
   checking, e.g., that `.claude/settings.json` is valid JSON has a weaker
   gate than the reference. This matters because Chapter 2.5's whole point
   is that permissions and configuration should be explicit and verified,
   not assumed.

5. **Independent understanding, not a copy.** If the submission's
   `.claude/settings.json`, directory layout, and test file are
   near-identical to the gold reference in wording and structure with no
   evidence of independent construction, note that explicitly per the
   anti-gaming guidance in the generic template.
