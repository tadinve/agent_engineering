"""Chapter 3 gate test: the five business-context files treated as one
system, not five independent files that each happen to be individually
valid.

Most real failures in a config system like this happen *between* files —
CLAUDE.md drifting out of sync with evidence-policy.yaml's actual
vocabulary, a voice rule silently contradicted by approved sales language,
a proof point sitting unused with no one noticing. Individually-valid YAML
doesn't catch any of that; these tests exist because Chapter 3's earlier
tests only look at one file at a time.
