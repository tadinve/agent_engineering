# Chapter 21 — Understanding Agent Failure

Agent systems fail in more ways than conventional applications because they combine probabilistic reasoning with tools, retrieved information, persistent state and external actions. This chapter establishes a systematic failure taxonomy for the rest of the section. Readers learn to distinguish model errors from tool failures, data problems, workflow defects and policy violations. The SDR Lab is instrumented to record failures explicitly, creating the foundation for targeted recovery rather than generic retries.

## 21.1 Model Failures

Models may misunderstand intent, fabricate details, ignore constraints, select the wrong tool or produce outputs that are plausible but unsupported. These failures may occur even when the surrounding infrastructure is operating correctly.

Readers will classify model failures by their observable effect rather than attempting to infer hidden reasoning. The system will record invalid decisions, unsupported claims and incomplete outputs as distinct failure types.

## 21.2 Tool and Integration Failures

Tools may time out, return invalid data, reject credentials or behave differently after an external API changes. A correct agent decision can therefore still lead to a failed task.

The system will distinguish failures caused by the selected tool from failures caused by incorrect tool selection. This distinction determines whether the correct response is retry, fallback, repair or escalation.

## 21.3 Data and Retrieval Failures

An agent may receive incomplete, stale, contradictory or malicious information. Retrieval can also return irrelevant passages even when the vector search itself succeeds.

Readers will define failure categories for missing evidence, low-quality sources, retrieval misses and unsupported synthesis. Data quality will be evaluated independently from model fluency.

## 21.4 Orchestration and State Failures

Workflows may execute stages out of order, lose intermediate results, repeat completed actions or resume from an invalid checkpoint. These failures often appear to be model problems but originate in coordination logic.

Readers will add transition validation and run-level diagnostics. Each workflow stage will expose its status, dependencies and recorded artifacts.

## 21.5 Security and Permission Failures

An agent may attempt an action beyond its authority, expose protected information or follow instructions embedded in untrusted content. Such events must be treated as security incidents rather than ordinary task failures.

Permission denials, injection attempts and policy violations will receive dedicated error classifications. They will not be retried as though they were temporary service problems.

## 21.6 Building an Agent Failure Taxonomy

The SDR Lab will adopt a structured failure object containing category, source, severity, retryability, affected stage and recommended response. This creates a shared language across tools, agents and operators.

Readers will deliberately introduce representative failures and verify that the system classifies them correctly. Later recovery mechanisms will depend on this taxonomy.
