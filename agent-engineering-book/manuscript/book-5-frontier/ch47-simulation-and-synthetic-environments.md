# Chapter 47 — Simulation and Synthetic Environments

Real-world testing of agent systems can be expensive, slow or unsafe. Simulation creates controlled environments containing synthetic users, adversarial inputs, tool behaviour and workload patterns. This chapter teaches readers to use simulations for broad coverage while recognizing their limitations. The SDR Lab gains a synthetic prospect environment for testing conversations, objections and policy boundaries.

## 47.1 Synthetic Users and Prospects

A synthetic user can represent a persona, objective, information set and behavioural pattern. It allows repeatable testing of interaction scenarios.

Readers will avoid defining only cooperative users. Personas will include ambiguity, impatience, inconsistent information and realistic objections.

## 47.2 Simulated Conversations

Conversation simulations allow the agent to practice discovery, clarification and objection handling over multiple turns. The transcript can be evaluated against task and policy rubrics.

The synthetic environment will control what the prospect knows and when it reveals information. This prevents evaluation from rewarding unsupported assumptions.

## 47.3 Adversarial Scenario Generation

Models can help generate unusual, malicious or contradictory test cases. Human review is required to ensure that generated scenarios are meaningful.

Readers will convert useful discoveries into stable regression tests. Synthetic diversity supplements, rather than replaces, expert red teaming.

## 47.4 Tool and Infrastructure Simulation

Mock tools can reproduce timeouts, malformed responses, changing data and permission errors without disrupting real services.

The simulation will support deterministic fault scenarios and reproducible trajectories. This strengthens resilience testing from Book 3.

## 47.5 Workload and Load Generation

Synthetic workloads can model account volumes, request mixes, burst patterns and tenant behaviour. They support capacity and cost analysis.

Readers will ensure that generated workloads reflect realistic task complexity rather than only request count. Expensive and failure-prone cases must be represented.

## 47.6 Limits of Synthetic Evaluation

Synthetic users may be overly logical, cooperative or similar to the model being tested. They can reward language that other models prefer but humans dislike.

Human evaluation and real operational data remain necessary. Simulation is best used for coverage, comparison and failure discovery.
