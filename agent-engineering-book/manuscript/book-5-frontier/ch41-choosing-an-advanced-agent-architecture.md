# Chapter 41 — Choosing an Advanced Agent Architecture

Advanced agent capabilities introduce substantial engineering and operational complexity. This chapter provides a decision framework for determining when computer use, voice, graph intelligence, simulation or model adaptation is justified. Readers evaluate task shape, modality, risk, cost and evidence before selecting an architecture. The resulting Architecture Decision Record becomes the starting point for the Book 5 capstone.

## 41.1 Matching Architecture to Task Shape

Tasks differ in whether they involve text, relationships, real-time conversation, visual interfaces or repeated specialist behaviour. Architecture should follow these characteristics.

Readers will map requirements to capabilities rather than beginning with a preferred technology. Many tasks will remain better served by the system already built in Books 1–4.

## 41.2 Modality and Interface Requirements

A text agent cannot interact reliably with every environment. Some applications require screen perception, audio, visual documents or direct manipulation of existing software.

The modality decision will consider whether a structured API or DOM is available before choosing visual computer use. More fragile interfaces require stronger verification.

## 41.3 Risk, Cost and Complexity

Each advanced capability adds new failure modes, infrastructure and evaluation requirements. Its benefit must justify those costs.

Readers will estimate operational risk, token usage, latency, data requirements and maintenance burden. Novelty alone will not count as value.

## 41.4 Evaluation Feasibility

An architecture should not be adopted unless its success and failure can be evaluated. Visual and conversational systems require specialized datasets and metrics.

Readers will define evaluation methods before implementation. Inability to measure the claimed advantage is a warning against proceeding.

## 41.5 Comparing Against a Simpler Baseline

Every advanced system needs a credible simpler baseline, such as a deterministic browser script, standard RAG or prompted general model.

The capstone will measure quality, reliability, latency and cost against this baseline. The advanced architecture must demonstrate a meaningful advantage.

## 41.6 Architecture Decision Records

An Architecture Decision Record documents context, alternatives, decision, consequences and evidence. It prevents later teams from treating design choices as unexplained facts.

Readers will create an ADR for their selected specialization. The document will be revisited after implementation to assess whether the original assumptions were correct.
