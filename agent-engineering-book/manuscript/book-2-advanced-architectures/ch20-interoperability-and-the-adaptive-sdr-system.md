# Chapter 20 — Interoperability and the Adaptive SDR System

The final chapter of Book 2 connects the advanced SDR system to external tools, data sources and remote agent capabilities. Readers distinguish the Model Context Protocol from agent-to-agent communication and examine discovery, authorization and durable execution across boundaries. The section concludes by integrating RAG, memory, planning, loops and multi-agent orchestration into a persistent account-intelligence system that can operate across sessions while remaining bounded and human-controlled.

## 20.1 Model Context Protocol

MCP provides a standardized way for agents to discover and invoke external tools, resources and prompts. It reduces the need for bespoke integration logic for every data system.

Readers will configure an MCP connection to an appropriate sandbox or local service. Tool access will remain governed by the same permission and approval policies used elsewhere in the project.

## 20.2 Agent-to-Agent Communication

Agent-to-agent communication allows one system to delegate a task to a remote specialist agent rather than directly invoking a tool. The remote agent may maintain its own state, reasoning and capabilities.

Readers will distinguish a remote agent from a simple API. Delegated tasks require identity, contracts, status tracking and trust boundaries.

## 20.3 Agent Discovery and Capability Descriptions

Before delegation, a system needs to understand what a remote agent can do, which inputs it accepts and what policies apply. Capability descriptions function as machine-readable service contracts.

Readers will evaluate descriptions for ambiguity, risk and compatibility. Discovery does not imply authorization to invoke every advertised capability.

## 20.4 Remote Tools and Remote Specialist Agents

The SDR system may use remote research, CRM or enrichment capabilities. Tools perform defined operations, while specialist agents may manage a more complex task trajectory.

The orchestrator must preserve provenance across the remote boundary. Results should identify the originating service, execution status and supporting evidence.

## 20.5 Multi-Session and Event-Driven Work

Persistent agents may resume on schedules or respond to events such as a new company announcement, CRM update or human approval decision. The trigger starts a new execution using existing state and memory.

Readers will design an event-driven account update without enabling autonomous outreach. The system will prepare an updated brief and await approval.

## 20.6 Integrating the Adaptive SDR Intelligence System

The Book 2 release will combine engineered context, internal RAG, persistent memory, durable state, bounded planning, controlled loops and specialist agents. MCP will provide access to at least one external data source or tool environment.

Readers will run the updated evaluation suite and compare results with the Book 1 MVP. Improvements in continuity and evidence coverage will be weighed against added complexity, token usage and latency.
